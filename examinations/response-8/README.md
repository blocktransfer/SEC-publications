in _The Psychology of Money_ by Morgan Housel:

> The danger here is that when compounding isn’t intuitive we often ignore its potential and focus on solving problems through other means. Not because we’re overthinking, but because we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.
> None of the 2,000 books picking apart Buffett’s success are titled _This Guy Has Been Investing Consistently for Three-Quarters of a Century_. But we know that’s the key to the majority of his success. It’s just hard to wrap your head around that math because it’s not intuitive.
> 
> There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But the most powerful and important book should be called _Shut Up And Wait_. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.

# Findings


## MSF Items







B. Maintenance of Master Securityholder File

Rule 17Ad-10(a)(1) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall promptly and accurately post to the master securityholder file debit and credits containing minimumand appropriate certificate detail representing every security transferred, purchased, redeemed orissued[^1]

[^1]: can do a good usbsection here with IL and cede setup]


Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall maintain and keep current an accurate master securityholder file and subsidiary files. If such transferagent has any record difference, its master securityholder file and subsidiary files must accuratelyrepresent all relevant debits and credits until the record differences is resolved. The recordkeeping transfer agent shall exercise diligent and continuous attention to resolve all record differences.

The Staff discovered the following exceptions during its review of the Laylor Corporation (“Laylor”) master securityholder file for the period of September 2023 through April 2025:


1. First Last (“Investor A”): In an email dated September 28, 2023, Laylor’s President, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. While some of the certificate detail required under Rule 17Ad-9(a)(2) and (5) under the Exchange Act appears in the Legacy Database, as evidenced in the excel spreadsheet of its output, BlockTrans did not post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain portion of the Master Securityholder File (“MSF”) for the issuance to this securityholder.

Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-10(a)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act, recordkeeping transfer agentsmust post credits containing minimum and appropriate certificate detail within 30 days after issuance. As the authorization for the issuance of Investor A’s shares is dated September 28, 2023, BlockTrans should have posted the credit of 100,000 shares to the MSF by October 28, 2023.

In addition, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor A disclosed that the data populating the “from” column (column J) reflected the Memo (HASH) from the transaction issuing another investor’s 300,000 shares. As a result, it appears that this data was mistakenly linked to Investor A’s certificate detail.[^2]

[^2]: subsubsection with start of issue auth convo...]
for excel _See_ TAR n.45


2. First Last (“Investor B”): This securityholder’s 1 million shares were revoked/cancelled on December 8, 2023, as a result of the clawback by the issuer. The shares were subsequently re-issued to Investor B pursuant to an email authorization from Laylor to BlockTrans on February 26, 2024. However, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor B disclosed that the issue date (“aqAt”), reflected in “holdings” column (column k) corresponded to the original establishment of the cancelled position on September 11, 2023, not February 26, 2024 (authorization date) or March 21, 2024 (date of transaction on the Stellar blockchain)[^3]

[^3]: DB design and good catch on the blockchain side..]




Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(a) under the Exchange Act for failing to post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain for the issuance to Investor A within the 30-day time frame, as well as for posting inaccurate certificate detail to the MSF for both Investors A and B.

Moreover, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act sincethese discrepancies caused BlockTrans’s MSF for Laylor to be inaccurate during the period of September 2023 through April 2025.


## control book items

C. Maintenance of Control Book

Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shallmaintain and keep current an accurate control book for each issue of securities. A change in the control book shall not be made except upon written authorization from a duly authorized agent of the issuer. Rule 17Ad-9(d) under the Exchange Act defines a control book as a record or other document that shows the total number of shares authorized and issued by the issuer.

As noted above, the issuer's email of September 28, 2023, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. The Registrant’s failure to post a credit for these shares to the blockchain portion of  the MSF resulted in understatement of Laylor’s issued share amount by 100,000 shares. Consequently, Laylor’s issued amount reflected on its Control Book was understated by 100,000 shares during the period of October 2023 through April 2025.

Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act for failing to maintain and keep current an accurate control book for Laylor.



# II. Weaknesses in Internal Controls, Supervisory Procedures, and Operational
Processes

## A. Written Procedures

### chacnged / neww identity  provider



re open source KYC we can frame as  the most trivial  thing to do b/c
(a) no fortnend so kskillz lol (matching) and
(b) story of 10k propriretary tooling usined at  Vstock (cold outreach basis)

https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-ecosystem-proposals#sep-0012---kyc-api






Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy – BlockTrans’s AML Policy reflects the use ofthe Persona platform in its Client Identity Verification process. BlockTrans currentlydocuments its verification process by adding an internal reference to the Persona account number (the “PSNA Reference”) within the securityholder’s Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). However, BlockTrans ceased using Persona during 2025 because of limitations of the screening application and costs of the service.

 Therefore, BlockTrans should update its AML Policy to reflect its new process for performing and documenting client identity verification







### Cancellation and Destruction of Securities Certificates

BlockTrans does not currently have written procedures pertaining to the cancellation and/or destruction of securities certificates. Rule 17Ad-19(b) under the Exchange Act requires every transfer agent involved in the handling, processing, or storage of securities certificates to establish and implement written procedures for the cancellation, storage, transportation, destruction, or other disposition of securities certificate. While the Registrant’s business model focuses on uncertificated shares, the Agreement for Transfer Services between BlockTrans and Laylor, dated June 30, 2023, instructed investors to mail prior physical stock certificates to BlockTrans for destruction. Even though BlockTrans did not receive any securities certificates during the Staff’s review period, it should establish written procedures for the cancellation and/or destruction of securities certificates in accordance with the Rule in the event that it does receive them. 



### Lost Securityholder Search Evidence

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s Unresponsive orLost User Policy disclosed that it does not require BlockTrans to maintain evidence of the specific search terms, search results, or screenshots/summaries of reports generated by
the search engines used. As a result, BlockTrans did not maintain such documentation.

Consequently, BlockTrans’s written procedures did not appear to be adequately designed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Rule. During the examination, the Registrant took steps to update its written procedures for Unresponsive or Lost User to incorporate requirements to document each search with comprehensive screenshots orgenerated reports that include the search date, search terms, and U.S. - based personal
identifiers


#### Idenitifaciton of Minors ../.

if "Gary Gensler, Clearinghouses Are the Answer", WALL ST. J. (Apr. 21, 2010) then lol r we  gonna listn






### Handling MailSecurities) 

The Staff’s discussions with BlockTrans disclosed that it currently uses PhysicalAddress for receipt and handling of its mail. PhysicalAddress scans envelopes received at the 99 Wall Street address for the Registrant and posts them on its platform for review by BlockTrans. The Registrant will then instruct PhysicalAddress on how to handle the item (i.e., forward, open/scan to pdf, or shred). However, BlockTrans has not established written procedures to define what category/type of mail should receive which treatment.

Rule 17Ad-12(a) under the Exchange Act states that any registered transfer agent that hascustody or possession of any funds or securities related to its transfer agent activities shall assure that (1) all such securities are held in safekeeping and handled, in light of all facts and circumstances, in a manner reasonably free from risk of theft, loss or destruction. As noted above, securityholders had been instructed to mail physical stock certificates to BlockTrans.


Although the Registrant has not received any physical certificates at the 99 Wall Street address, BlockTrans’ failure to have a documented methodology for handling different categories/types of mail received at a virtual business address appears to be an internal control weakness.



(start subsubsection  on cert  policing)


#### Extendign Safeguarding  Interpretive proxy

Firstr o f all,  I would like to commend the Commission for bringing transfer agentr regualtions back onto the proposed-rule  stage earlier this moonth.[^rin] I partiucally appreciate how this is the only one of  23  agency  rules with an regualtory classification under E.O. 14192. If I might say so, transfer agents offer the perfect outdated regulatory regime to update with the leeway given  by any defregulations.

NAmely, in jsut a few monhtss we'll reach the ten-year annivaersary of staff  contemplations of TA market structure in S7-27-15.  In this time, the monoply  concerns raised about DTCC  have only strengthened as  they  rollout an industry-encompassing[^totla-ccontrol] ssystem  designed  to encompass all U.S. assets.[^pprev-psure] Unlike other Proposed urlemaking, 3235-AL55 has a single congressional authority.[^dtmnd]

I  find this single public-policy  rrpecedence Judiciously relevant  on  the basis of limited past TA operational controls , especialyl  those droppped from June 12th's "regulatyr reset."[^rr-osc] fro time, I'll elaborate on two of  the policy choices impliccated in meeting remarks over ta ijtnenral protections. In contemplating these ideas, I have  to  ask myself, :"might clear, public rules on GitHub Solicit trust?"



[^totla-ccontrol]: I commented extensively on the horendous unilateral authority implicit in the design of DTCC Digital Assets ("DA"), _available at_ https://lnns.co/O8NUZfc1KGe. _See also_ blog post published the day Dave reahed out to begin the  examination process, subtitled with  a  critiqe  on "keeping control centralized" in whaat the title purports is aa master plan for unchecked power, _available at_ https://genfinity.io/2025/04/30/dtcc-on-chain-patent-global-finance-takeover.  THe author repsondds to a patent application from DTCC which substantially mimics my own, albeit with mucch less public transprency. Should we really alow complex widespread rollout for dozens of untested proprietary conteracts without a mucch as even an Advanced Notice?

proponenets o f DTCC-DA  have remarked that  non-NMS optikons are insecure `parallle/side markets` without  investor protections

offer through  a decentralized frmaework  for  decentralized market

purport ot  uspport  competition (the exchanges, direct  callout  of monoppoily staturing wihtout duoipoly citation)

while  supporting, endorsing, and integrating  DTCC-DA's central  control 
_See_ _supra_ note [^totla-ccontrol]






[^rin]: _See_ statmenet  on the o ublic release  pof tSpring's regulatory  fglexability agenda  from Chair Atkins earlier this month, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-2025-regulatory-agenda-090425.  The agenda item in RIN 3235-AL55 offers a uniqeu opporruntiy for "simplifying pathways for raising capital and investor access to private businesses." I sincerely  appreciate its reitroduction and agree with all processing designations elected brilliantly.

[^pprev-psure]: _See_ DA's  encompasssing grasp opn financial  instutions and investable  assets  in the TAR letter at § II.D.1 ¶¶ 8, 13, and 16–18. Should we  contnue handing American savings andd retirments i nto the opaque custody of an  entity which is alreaddy  too big to fail ? Suuch view was explicitly  eloquated by the author of the patent in coprated by refernce in  _Id._ _See, e.g,_ substantiated professionals supporting critiqes of singular custody nomiinees with both industry and academic evidence  pointing to yet anther  public bailout in TAR letter nn. 51, 106, and 143–145.


[^dtmnd]: At  least  for  proposed items with a defined legal authortity  from _supra_ note {{^rin}}, with one important safe-harbor  consideration citing basis in 57 rules. _See also_ the specific trasnsf-eragnet  item, _available at_ https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202504&RIN=3235-AL55. With legislative standing frp,m the NMS Statute, might  we have a  greater burnedon of investigation than standard notice and commenting? Again, subparagraph (f)(2)(A)(ii) spells out hte need  for enhanced FAC review "in the absence of a uniform rule" for saafety.;



[^rr-osc]: This has b een one colloquial refernce  ot the 14 dropped rule changes within online p rofessional circles, refering the derefulatory staff actions at, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2025/33-11377.pdf. _See also generally_ Commissioner Atkin's remarks  that this _is_ (*emphasis orginally thoughp9tu publications) a new day at the agency, wwhich is  great. I'll keep this citation short to keep focus  on  the direct  action changes above,  which  stouched some very significant policy items from the klast  Administration. Extraordinary  cmmitment to free markets.





##### SCI

When I toured Geoprgia Tech in high school, thje student guide made  great efforts  to point out hte Klaus Advanced Computing Building, one of the  more striking buildigs o n ccampuswhere I  attended  many graduate  cryptogrpahy classes.  chris Klaus also happened to  be a  leading donor proponent of CREATE-X,  the  euntrperneeur incubation and promotion program discussed in our first two meetings.[^createx] The guidde tol us about how Klaus dropped out to persue his cybersecurity  startup, which sold  to IBM for over $2,000,000,000.[^inflation]

In my  early-action appliation top Tech, I explicitly mentioned the program in terms of my first blockchain startup, mMMonerAds.[^man-relevance] Uponadmission , i applied  to the submmer  profram freshman year. However, I was told after pitching a penale on my ideas that I could not joing wihtout a cofounder.

This began years of wresting with otheer peoples' vision  for how I should run a transgfer agency,[^notad]  since  "most  startups fail without a cofounder."[^apprx]  Whiel I apprecciate thos entiments, I found the discipline to  patiently wait for the right opportunity in  the unforgiving Indifferencce of market quiet. This approach paidd off four  yeras later when I encountered the excpetional partner cited in PREV  § III.

ONe year after m ,eeting Jerry in _supra_ note {{notad}}, he began teaching graduate cyberseucrty  classes. They introduced me  to the  immense centralized  risks  of concerntring market PII and MNPI ,[^intro-frens] exmeplified  in Ex . 8.8,  a report  on the Equifax data breach. Throughout the semester, we'd walk after lecturees disucssing market  structure and contemplateions on ssecuring a self-custody blockchain TAD.





we  havce now  a complex override  of a lot including Reg SCI changes "SEC emphasized that as market structure evolved, systemic risk also extended beyond traditional exchanges and clearing agencies."

This experiinec gave me respect  for small-business cpaital formatioon, as Donna commented on July 15th.


[^inflation]: Inn 2025  dollars.


[^man-relevance]: I cited these years ofexperience in our first meeting as background for the remote-dirst organizatioonal design which I understand to  best efficiently  orgnazie a free-software working community.  I find relevant  the publis Secretarof-of-State filings ;'s privacy reldactions and inclusions, _available at_ https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/Business_Registration_profile/14324280. North  Caolrina follows's the  commission's policy of censoring emails while publishing full physical addresses and  phgone numbers. However, I disagree with their requirmenet of a "principal opffice" which was my parent's house asnd, in the Articles  avaliable under "View  Filings"  with No. C201815700063, the fmaily  residence of a friend.

[^notad]: Nobody understood what a TAD was, and  it was too  mcuh  effort with the scarse public documentation back  then  to  satisfactory  convince them of  the need  for such  a new  system. Namely, I was  bafflingly unfamiliar with the TAR letter'ss PCO event, despite an explicit suprise reference thereto in a school pitch competition touted by the tour  guide which immedeiatyley  intreuiged me, _available at_ https://youtu.be/S75IvkicWD8. THe m onths of pitching prepration for this show introduced me to valuable earl yonnections, many o f whom are in the exmaple shareholder ledger prop, _available at_ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgBoJeKZ_EPy8Dlwd4dARyRCniqcET0VR1IDkrx4kKY/pub. one  paritcualtlryu relevant judge fdrom  early  pitch-practice and  application sessions was Jerry {Perullo, the ICE CISO for two decaddes quotesd  in  the EDGAR comment at 21.

[^apprx]: Approximate paraphrase  of  the repeated statistics I heard regaurding  failed solo foudners.  Ex. 8.7 is a reponse to this critique drafted at the end of 2019 and submitted to the comittee early  in 2020 to finalize my rejected iingagural application. This ultimately let me move on from a venture which  was frnakly harmful to the environment and consumer technology, as I had practically came  to recognize  mby the later stages of the  applciatin process.  THerafter, I published my thesxis and, within a year pushign through COVId hardships, incorpoated the early-fform Registrant. 



[^intro-frens]: These two  fdeadly  acronyms have  been tmy  top concenrns  in open0-sourcing  Syndicate  ifnrastructure  over the last years. I  found  in early  development  efforts  details  _infra_ § {{TODO:team section number}}  that it can be challenging  to  extensively test interface deplyoments without established and volumnous sample data.  This is why  I issued  teh DEMO asset from the Syndicate's mainnet account, facilitating early code sprints.  I plan to overccome this  challenge  with  future  testneet integrations and faker users.

## B. MSF Certificate Detail


### Securities  Cancellation Dates

This information is required as part of the minimum certificate detail pursuant to Rule 17Ad-9(a) under the Exchange Act. Cancellation dates are reflected on the Stellar blockchain and for securityholders who opened Accounts/Wallets on Stellar (the “Stellar Accounts”) are readily obtainable. However, for those securityholders without Stellar Accounts whose shares are held in the “Distribution Account”, there is no clear audit trail that records the number of shares cancelled by securityholder or the date of cancellation. To obtain this information on a securityholder level, BlockTrans would have to review several sources to determine the number of shares cancelled and the cancel date.

As a result, BlockTrans does not maintain or have readily accessible the cancellation dates or share amounts for cancelled securities of securityholders allocating to the Distribution Account.


### Deleted Certificate Detail

#### backups in CRON and pen...

For those securityholders who don’t maintain StellarAccounts, the Registrant will manually delete certificate detail for cancelled securities. At present, deleted certificate detail for these securityholders would be reflected in backup files maintained by BlockTrans. However, the Registrant does not have a process to back-up and maintain the certificate detail for these securityholders which resides in the Legacy Database.

Rule 17Ad-10(f) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agentshall retain a record of all certificate detail deleted from the master securityholder file for a period of six years from the date of deletion. In lieu of maintaining a hard copy, a recordkeeping transfer agent may comply with this paragraph by complying with §240.17Ad-7(f) or §240.17Ad-7(g).

BlockTrans’ failure to establish a process to ensure that back-up files of the Legacy Database are maintained is an internal control weakness, as such process could ensure that BlockTrans maintains a record of certificate detail deleted from the MSF as required by Rule 17Ad-10(f) under the Exchange Act.

## OFAC Searches

_DC_ form reposnsse 5  note 7 goal
conflicts with ofac  snctioning an entire country










C. U.S. Department of Treasury – Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) –

BlockTrans Does Not Maintain or Implement Written Procedures Related to Its OFAC Searches



Every person or business in the U.S., including all securities transfer agents, must monitor transactions to blocked countries, and to certain identified individuals, by comparing and matching information against current lists (www.treas.gov/ofac) maintained by OFAC.

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s procedures revealed that the Registrant does not address OFAC compliance. However, the Registrant verbally disclosed that it utilized the Persona platform for screening against OFAC’s list of specially designated nationals (“SDNs”), which was evidenced by adding a PSNA Reference within the securityholder’s PII. However, the Staff’s review of the output from the Legacy Database disclosed two securityholders, Investors C and D, whose PII did not include a PSNA Reference, indicating they had not been screened.
Further, based on the Staff’s conversations with BlockTrans, it appears that these screenings were performed only at the time a securityholder was onboarded, rather than periodically which would be more prudent for a dynamic list like OFAC’s SDNs.

Therefore, BlockTrans’ failure to maintain written procedures addressing OFAC regulations, and to conduct OFAC searches for these two securityholders is an internal control weakness.

BlockTrans could consult OFAC’s website at http://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information to review its obligations underOFAC’s mandate and make any changes deemed by the Firm to be necessary for compliance.

The instructions for Form TA-1 disclose that a filer should “State in Question 3.c. the full address ofthe registrant’s principal office where transfer agent activities are, or will be, performed.”

BlockTrans’s current Form TA-1/A, dated September 25, 2023, reflects a principal office address of 99 Wall Street #4640, New York, NY 10005 (“99 Wall Street”)

The Staff’s discussions with the Registrant revealed that the 99 Wall Street address is the location of a virtual business addressservice, PhysicalAddress.com (“PhysicalAddress”), that receives/handles mail for clients.

BlockTrans does not maintain any personnel at that location. Likewise, it does not appear that BlockTrans performs any transfer agent activities at that location.

by reorganizing the underlying network topologies, while the problem of ‘too large to fail’ remains, at least
to a certain extent. It is reasonable to conclude that for systemic risk-efficient allocations (i.e. the optimized
networks) the individual systemic risk becomes more proportional to liabilities
