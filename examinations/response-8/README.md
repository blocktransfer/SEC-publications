'd lketo start wit a big thank o staff for their throgouh inolvment throghou this eview. I sincrely appreciate all the finding in teh 14 Aug 2025 Defficinecy Letter within Appendix A (the "Findings"). Although I understand hte exam began as a check on our frst lost investors, it grew to be so much mre.

This wouldn't have been possible without the express deicated efforts of yourself, Ms. Gallagher, and Mr. Martin; oall of whom I understnad worked  tirelessly to understand the account systems I developed. For all the silent effot the team of staff within the examination put in, thank you. The technical learnings amazed.

> None of the 2,000 books picking apart Buffett’s success are titled _This Guy Has Been Investing Consistently for Three-Quarters of a Century_. But we know that’s the key to the majority of his success. It’s just hard to wrap your head around that math because it’s not intuitive.

# Findings


## MSF Items







B. Maintenance of Master Securityholder File

Rule 17Ad-10(a)(1) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall promptly and accurately post to the master securityholder file debit and credits containing minimumand appropriate certificate detail representing every security transferred, purchased, redeemed orissued[^1]

[^1]: can do a good usbsection here with IL and cede setup]


Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shall maintain and keep current an accurate master securityholder file and subsidiary files. If such transferagent has any record difference, its master securityholder file and subsidiary files must accuratelyrepresent all relevant debits and credits until the record differences is resolved. The recordkeeping transfer agent shall exercise diligent and continuous attention to resolve all record differences.

The Staff discovered the following exceptions during its review of the Laylor Corporation ("Laylor") master securityholder file for the period of September 2023 through April 2025:


1. First Last ("Investor A"): In an email dated September 28, 2023, Laylor’s President, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. While some of the certificate detail required under Rule 17Ad-9(a)(2) and (5) under the Exchange Act appears in the Legacy Database, as evidenced in the excel spreadsheet of its output, BlockTrans did not post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain portion of the Master Securityholder File ("MSF") for the issuance to this securityholder.

Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-10(a)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act, recordkeeping transfer agentsmust post credits containing minimum and appropriate certificate detail within 30 days after issuance. As the authorization for the issuance of Investor A’s shares is dated September 28, 2023, BlockTrans should have posted the credit of 100,000 shares to the MSF by October 28, 2023.

In addition, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor A disclosed that the data populating the "from" column (column J) reflected the Memo (HASH) from the transaction issuing another investor’s 300,000 shares. As a result, it appears that this data was mistakenly linked to Investor A’s certificate detail.[^2]

[^2]: subsubsection with start of issue auth convo...]
for excel _See_ TAR n.45





https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/d80c385d1644eb2e1e01ed41623ba3f2c1c598bf/micro/2025/Jun/24.md


https://github.com/blocktransfer/syndicate-api/issues/3



2. First Last ("Investor B"): This securityholder’s 1 million shares were revoked/cancelled on December 8, 2023, as a result of the clawback by the issuer. The shares were subsequently re-issued to Investor B pursuant to an email authorization from Laylor to BlockTrans on February 26, 2024. However, the Staff’s review of the information maintained on the Legacy Database for Investor B disclosed that the issue date ("aqAt"), reflected in "holdings" column (column k) corresponded to the original establishment of the cancelled position on September 11, 2023, not February 26, 2024 (authorization date) or March 21, 2024 (date of transaction on the Stellar blockchain)[^3]

[^3]: DB design and good catch on the blockchain side..]




Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(a) under the Exchange Act for failing to post the credit of 100,000 shares to the blockchain for the issuance to Investor A within the 30-day time frame, as well as for posting inaccurate certificate detail to the MSF for both Investors A and B.

Moreover, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(b) under the Exchange Act sincethese discrepancies caused BlockTrans’s MSF for Laylor to be inaccurate during the period of September 2023 through April 2025.


## control book items

C. Maintenance of Control Book

Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act states that every recordkeeping transfer agent shallmaintain and keep current an accurate control book for each issue of securities. A change in the control book shall not be made except upon written authorization from a duly authorized agent of the issuer. Rule 17Ad-9(d) under the Exchange Act defines a control book as a record or other document that shows the total number of shares authorized and issued by the issuer.

As noted above, the issuer's email of September 28, 2023, authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares to Investor A. The Registrant’s failure to post a credit for these shares to the blockchain portion of  the MSF resulted in understatement of Laylor’s issued share amount by 100,000 shares. Consequently, Laylor’s issued amount reflected on its Control Book was understated by 100,000 shares during the period of October 2023 through April 2025.

Therefore, BlockTrans is not in compliance with Rule 17Ad-10(e) under the Exchange Act for failing to maintain and keep current an accurate control book for Laylor.













##  §2 Internal and Proceduaral Weaknesses

###  Client Identity Verification Procewss

Hadnnking kYC inforation has alwyas been the msot centralized function  I envisioned  for thee SYndicate. It  rleated deepl yto   my aspireaitons in Response 5 note 7  to disintermediate wall Street, because o f a  principle I commonly ccite  called Conway's Law. The rule[^conway=paper]  originateds from a paper on  the innonvative capacity  of committees, w hich I've seen repeatedly fail to ourperform independnet  moeny managers  given the leeway to allocate capital as  they see fit within their own small groups. Put more applcicably, all  my investing  epxerience sccreaams  to  me that  small  teams are the m ost e fficient deployment  of resources, adn as such I've designed all possible posilicies to  support  decentralized  autonomous  teams  of orgnaization memebrs without explicit directive  overhead  or managemnet.

The cchallenge and opporuntiy with KYC lies in the intimate bonding requirements to  proccess PII. Even in the legacy  OPpersona implementation, internal team members needed  to login and authentiaccakte identieis. Thiss processing reality conflicts with my visioon for peromsisioneless working arrangments wheere contributors have  a minnmumal set of sensitive permissions, electing to work on any public repos.

My  intial rememdy was  to outsource this to a proprietary development company abcked by the  titans of Sand Hill. This worked fine while the Syndicate waas still copletely centralized priorr to discovereing the communtiy. But no that we are migrating to open standdards together, a central service provider for such a crucial part of investor onboarding threatens the envisioned open team concepts I hold s odearly

The Deficincy  Letter cites our disconitnued  use of the legacy rpovidor partluy  due to ccosts of the service. While this was a factor,  money  is  not particiuualy  an  item in my  mind when it  comes ot  investor ptoections.[^sel-psn] The bigger problem I s ee comeds from the internalization of ercnomies of scale and platform netowrk effects withihn a poor copoate govenrance framwrok, as happeneed to DTCC [^mercy]


[^conway=paper]: _See_ su mmary of original paper by the author alongside the source text, _available at_ https://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html. To the briefest extent possible, Conway proposes what I have seen so intimately trading nascent ccrypto markets  in comparison  to entranches futuers derivatives. These are two extrrmes  of a  spectrum defined  by  insitutional adoptiona and entranching regulation, r and the movement  of these assets in the fre market  deeply  reflects that . Watching price action subtly change after  the introdfuction  of CME  bitcoin futures really showed me that the thought behind market  strucutre changes ccan have downstream impliccations for ddecades to  come, legitimatley  shaping  society


[^sel-psn]: as cited  in earlier  work inclduding primative grant applications not ccommunciated, Persona  as i udnerstand it is one of the m ost expensive iddentity  vverification services  avaliable.  I selected  to after extensive diligence into yst about every  reputable identiity  provicer. and even primative  prototype implementtions used alternatives such as Blokcpass ti test onboarding flows. I foundd that the stramlines user interface and edirect document secuyrity features of  the Persona platform far exceeded competing offerings, and so i ppiicked  it as the best possible existing solution to start



[^mercy]: _See, e.g.,_ 5remakrs on a centralized financial insuttionss attending a techn conference, selling banking ssxerrivces avalibale for merely $35,000 a months from an infrastructure broker spoek nwith during extensive banking relation ivestigatgions, _available at_ https://x.com/JFWooten4/status/1854654933498552550. I've seen at lead three leading identity  software vendors in similar booths at events including the main industry Bitcoin conference. iN all instances, I'm sinccrely dissapointed  by the extravent waste of corpoate funds which could be trivially reinvested in to product devleopment or cost  decreases. I do not believe truly efficient  systjms should need pander to mass audiences through   xchepa branded handouts and an  array  of agents politcking the platform into mainstream adoption sales.


#### Electing OCMmuntiy Netwokr effects

Throughotu 2024,  I developed a centralized product roadmpa  for expanding our business on the basis of a collaboration arrangment and NDA in Ex. 8.1.1 with a well-connected financial insuttion.[^git] I embarked on  these experiementations with the aprpoovatl of a communtiy vote.[^instrets]  Extensive disusccsion  ensued around these interactions in a braod principled manner, and I would be happy to share direct links with staff if they might confirm Commission ability to acccess and review messages  in a publidcc Dsdciord server.

However, even  this dusicsussion platfomr has centralization challenges introduced through account permissiones. Lastl  year really clarified  that for m e while I  explored what a alrgedr-scale deplopyment of technology closer to TAD2 would look like. FOr isntnace,  Ex 8.1.2 detials a fiat deposit flow using  partner banks before the adoption of this year's new stablecoin ledgislation and protectioons.

The KYC flows for this  work presumed the use of Perosna, and we hadd extensive back-and-frorth with the entity and thier counsel to connect instances and data in  a potential launch .  I saw here the vendor lock-in challenge  with ddifferent agendts  using the proproietary Persona daashboard, as data stayed isolated  in their  servers with a single entity  conntrolling access and review. As the  grouop kept insisting on using Plygon, a level 2 with  centralized consensus, it became clear that the focus here was adoption and corporate profits  over and above impact andd safety.

I've  seen  this viewpoit andd  technology mature into a consortum of ideas championed by DTCC,[^investors] andd I it  truly  idsspapoints me eeing how these entralized teams produces such centralized products.[^broekrs] as I saw this work mature aroun broker-dealers, it would haave been trivial to discount our values and regualtory committment  to stbaility for a piece of  the old financial game they control. but i just don't think a long-term solution wil lwork if it's not corroberated from the bottom-up with small-business and innovation as core developmental drivers as value focuses.




[^git]: despit eepxlicit  provisions designed  to allow project codep  ublications i n § 14.3, I contually facced challenges bringing development oinline through community venues. Th e  team on their end was not compfortbale with or already using  GitHub, and  they  didn't even have the inclination to join a project-spoecific DIscxord server wqithout public refrences. This closed developmetn cycle and a relentless foccus on specific partner functions  without any deliverable discussions between engineering  teams made integrations challenging. They wanted us to act as agent for some large delas, but I disagreed with the large cut we'd  take from investor returns.


[^instrets]: The poll giving me preloiminary apprval of our designs as theorcised  as entirely positive, as members were unteresting in any  steps forward  to structural market change. When voting in early January this year, Chives reamrked: "Naturally we'd rather see issuers seek to provide a custody first best-of-all-worlds solution, but taking a step towards blockchain and public auditability even if firmly in the old ways (TAD2) is still a step in the right direction. A syndicate tad2 could still outcompete and still be a relevant step forward for the industry." My  didsccofort in the level of centrlaizatioon regardless of positifve sentiments back  then lead  to mucch of my inspiration to reform our ownership structure nad corpoate Bylawes today, pending the TAR letter approval  turnaround period.

[^investors]: The centralized aspects of the o itken finfrasturcure go entirely against my investor poerioties and decentralizedexpansion precendent in _Id._ _See_ DTCC's annoucncement purportedly supporting "open-source[] token standard" tehccnolgoies while using ap roporitetary trademark to brand  their o wn deployments  of communa; free so0ftware on privatge centralized servers with secrative  ionternal consens, _available at_ https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/march/20/dtcc-joins-erc3643-association. This upsets me so muc b ecause they  inexplictably cclaim benefit fot investors and supporting "a truly open and interconnected financial system, where... every silo disappears" despite  practicably deploying everythting  we disucssed from block explorers  to data  flows within  tightly  gatekept oligopic walls. I'm amking the executive choicce  to  ignor temporarily the infuriating swath of  contradictions in their public statements as a start, but I am happy to contue elabroatinin a FAC based on public baarainstorming, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/SEC-publications/issues/11.

[^broekrs]: Exs. 8.1.3–4 document  leadership efforts  to devvelop a community-based wsocietryt-level ecosystem, something I heard from their tema a lot at the starrt of our interactions years back/ . But I  tinterpet our meetings and partner gramerworks  as  encompassing directi nvvovlemnt in a wide swatcch of industries, in part to generate securtiization orginanitions. Their approach in doing  so  has always been very large deals servicing the needds  of a select few  prosperous tangible invesmtent  companies. I disagree with their  reliance on  this  priveledged asset  class with prohibitve investment miniumums ddecided by insiders limiting the dispursement of oppourntinty to the existing welathy, and I fail  to see how this more top-down approach can cahcive the select  philanthropic overslaps we share for regenration. <!-- deference to Bur on basis of decentralized comms -->

#### Updating Public Policy Statments

Staff cdid a great  job uncovering  the discrpeency in our public polcy's AML processing page.[^aml=-discrpncies] One reason this persisted past our use of PSNA References through the admin console comes to contemplations over adata access. A community post in note 6 link 1 refres to a Dsicord thread in the lumants communtiyt, _available at_ https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/d80c385d1644eb2e1e01ed41623ba3f2c1c598bf/group/stellar/retroactive-scf/community-discussions.md.

I've been  thinking  a little  dtoo  deeply  about the storagfe of information in  a standdalone identity suite, as I';e wanted  to use MPC  "to replace our AWS stack with newly decentralized infrastructure to get our projects fully onchain (among pros)." I;ve been exlporing this path  for over a year in the investor  communtiy  through hosting our podcast, reference files, and datbase config, with the help of James. However, I understand now that i must sideline this for a more immediate implementaion , and this works fine since it's easier to secure data on a centralized servcer  instancce anway./

We w ill update website policies to refl;ect  the propoer processes and use  of peronal information for KYC, as a staff can  track  on a public codebase i ssue, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/website/issues/8.[^site-cde]  As expressed in the postscript of PREV's  cover l etter, I do not work well with directive centralized deadlines, and I've designed all our  poperations to  conform  to asynchornous contibutions made at the  behest  of decentralized members.[^duna-org]  I do not expect the old terms will have any  effect on our inagural client becuase investors have not onboarded for their securities in years.

This "waiting period" for Examination was the other main reaosn  I havne't  fone in to overhaul  these policies. THe PSNA Reference token is deeeply  ingrained in data standards and operational expectations.[^psnause]  I'm glad we were all able to get on the same page with  signarture garuntee polcies reliant on cryptographic ccredentialy  s associated in the investor's cusotdy and associate with identity for recovery.

[^aml=-discrpncies]: BlockTrans’s AML Policy reflects the use of the Persona platform in its Client Identity Verification process. BlockTrans currently documents its verification process by adding an internal reference to the Persona account number (the "PSNA Reference") within the securityholder’s Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). However, BlockTrans ceased using Persona during 2025 because of limitations of the screening application and costs of the service. Therefore, BlockTrans should update its AML Policy to reflect its new process for performing and documenting client identity verification

[^site-cde]: Upon completion of the Exmaination, i mgirated our home-domain website ot the main publicc instance. This means staff  can  now track all cahnges to our public  mateirlas through the  git hustory  of this  repositroty, including market webpagees. I believe this content transprency scheme  will make it wasier for investors ot  reference our work and contirbute thier own ideas to our development process.  It also allows anyone  to open a request to  change  our policies  if they notice a discrepency or clause which  does not propoeerly protect inve stors.

Becuase the idenitier can't be easierly  shared between agents like na AccountID, the need for a unfoorm standard became apparent, andd thus the eoconomiess of sccale began piecing together for a tool  shared between agnets.  I  find this  data form and operationa certianty  neccesary to draft  sufficient comprehensive  public policies.

C. U.S. Department of Treasury – Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") –

BlockTrans Does Not Maintain or Implement Written Procedures Related to Its OFAC Searches

_thye shoiuyd reach  out  dir_

Every person or business in the U.S., including all securities transfer agents, must monitor transactions to blocked countries, and to certain identified individuals, by comparing and matching information against current lists (www.treas.gov/ofac) maintained by OFAC.

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s procedures revealed that the Registrant does not address OFAC compliance. However, the Registrant verbally disclosed that it utilized the Persona platform for screening against OFAC’s list of specially designated nationals ("SDNs"), which was evidenced by adding a PSNA Reference within the securityholder’s PII. However, the Staff’s review of the output from the Legacy Database disclosed two securityholders, Investors C and D, whose PII did not include a PSNA Reference, indicating they had not been screened.
Further, based on the Staff’s conversations with BlockTrans, it appears that these screenings were performed only at the time a securityholder was onboarded, rather than periodically which would be more prudent for a dynamic list like OFAC’s SDNs.

Therefore, BlockTrans’ failure to maintain written procedures addressing OFAC regulations, and to conduct OFAC searches for these two securityholders is an internal control weakness.

BlockTrans could consult OFAC’s website at http://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information to review its obligations underOFAC’s mandate and make any changes deemed by the Firm to be necessary for compliance.

### Lost Securityholder Search Evidence

The Staff’s review of BlockTrans’s Unresponsive orLost User Policy disclosed that it does not require BlockTrans to maintain evidence of the specific search terms, search results, or screenshots/summaries of reports generated by
the search engines used. As a result, BlockTrans did not maintain such documentation.

Consequently, BlockTrans’s written procedures did not appear to be adequately designed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Rule. During the examination, the Registrant took steps to update its written procedures for Unresponsive or Lost User to incorporate requirements to document each search with comprehensive screenshots orgenerated reports that include the search date, search terms, and U.S. - based personal
identifiers

### Handling MailSecurities) 

The Staff’s discussions with BlockTrans disclosed that it currently uses PhysicalAddress for receipt and handling of its mail. PhysicalAddress scans envelopes received at the 99 Wall Street address for the Registrant and posts them on its platform for review by BlockTrans. The Registrant will then instruct PhysicalAddress on how to handle the item (i.e., forward, open/scan to pdf, or shred). However, BlockTrans has not established written procedures to define what category/type of mail should receive which treatment.

Rule 17Ad-12(a) under the Exchange Act states that any registered transfer agent that hascustody or possession of any funds or securities related to its transfer agent activities shall assure that (1) all such securities are held in safekeeping and handled, in light of all facts and circumstances, in a manner reasonably free from risk of theft, loss or destruction. As noted above, securityholders had been instructed to mail physical stock certificates to BlockTrans.


Although the Registrant has not received any physical certificates at the 99 Wall Street address, BlockTrans’ failure to have a documented methodology for handling different categories/types of mail received at a virtual business address appears to be an internal control weakness.

#### Extendign Safeguarding  Interpretive proxy

Firstr o f all,  I would like to commend the Commission for bringing transfer agentr regualtions back onto the proposed-rule  stage earlier this moonth.[^rin] I partiucally appreciate how this is the only one of  23  agency  rules with an regualtory classification under E.O. 14192. If I might say so, transfer agents offer the perfect outdated regulatory regime to update with the leeway given  by any defregulations.

NAmely, in jsut a few monhtss we'll reach the ten-year annivaersary of staff  contemplations of TA market structure in S7-27-15.  In this time, the monoply  concerns raised about DTCC  have only strengthened as  they  rollout an industry-encompassing[^totla-ccontrol] ssystem  designed  to encompass all U.S. assets.[^pprev-psure] Unlike other Proposed urlemaking, 3235-AL55 has a single congressional authority.[^dtmnd]

I  find this single public-policy  rrpecedence Judiciously relevant  on  the basis of limited past TA operational controls , especialyl  those droppped from June 12th's "regulatyr reset."[^rr-osc] fro time, I'll elaborate on two of  the policy choices impliccated in meeting remarks over ta ijtnenral protections. In contemplating these ideas, I have  to  ask myself, :"might clear, public rules on GitHub Solicit trust?"

[^rin]: _See_ statmenet  on the o ublic release  pof tSpring's regulatory  fglexability agenda  from Chair Atkins earlier this month, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-2025-regulatory-agenda-090425.  The agenda item in RIN 3235-AL55 offers a uniqeu opporruntiy for "simplifying pathways for raising capital and investor access to private businesses." I sincerely  appreciate its reitroduction and agree with all processing designations elected brilliantly.

[^totla-ccontrol]: I commented extensively on the horendous unilateral authority implicit in the design of DTCC Digital Assets ("DA"), _available at_ https://lnns.co/O8NUZfc1KGe. _See also_ blog post published the day Dave reahed out to begin the  examination process, subtitled with  a  critiqe  on "keeping control centralized" in whaat the title purports is aa master plan for unchecked power, _available at_ https://genfinity.io/2025/04/30/dtcc-on-chain-patent-global-finance-takeover.  THe author repsondds to a patent application from DTCC which substantially mimics my own, albeit with mucch less public transprency. Should we really alow complex widespread rollout for dozens of untested proprietary conteracts without a mucch as even an Advanced Notice?

[^pprev-psure]: _See_ DA's  encompasssing grasp opn financial  instutions and investable  assets  in the TAR letter at § II.D.1 ¶¶ 8, 13, and 16–18. Should we  contnue handing American savings andd retirments i nto the opaque custody of an  entity which is alreaddy  too big to fail ? Suuch view was explicitly  eloquated by the author of the patent in coprated by refernce in  _Id._ _See, e.g,_ substantiated professionals supporting critiqes of singular custody nomiinees with both industry and academic evidence  pointing to yet anther  public bailout in TAR letter nn. 51, 106, and 143–145.


[^dtmnd]: At  least  for  proposed items with a defined legal authortity  from _supra_ note {{^rin}}, with one important safe-harbor  consideration citing basis in 57 rules. _See also_ the specific trasnsf-eragnet  item, _available at_ https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202504&RIN=3235-AL55. With legislative standing frp,m the NMS Statute, might  we have a  greater burnedon of investigation than standard notice and commenting? Again, subparagraph (f)(2)(A)(ii) spells out hte need  for enhanced FAC review "in the absence of a uniform rule" for saafety.;



[^rr-osc]: This has b een one colloquial refernce  ot the 14 dropped rule changes within online p rofessional circles, refering the derefulatory staff actions at, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2025/33-11377.pdf. _See also generally_ Commissioner Atkin's remarks  that this _is_ (*emphasis orginally thoughp9tu publications) a new day at the agency, wwhich is  great. I'll keep this citation short to keep focus  on  the direct  action changes above,  which  stouched some very significant policy items from the klast  Administration. Extraordinary  cmmitment to free markets.





###### SCI and Cybersecutity Protections

When I toured Geoprgia Tech in high school, thje student guide made  great efforts  to point out hte Klaus Advanced Computing Building, one of the  more striking buildigs o n ccampuswhere I  attended  many graduate  cryptogrpahy classes.  chris Klaus also happened to  be a  leading donor proponent of CREATE-X,  the  euntrperneeur incubation and promotion program discussed in our first two meetings.[^createx] The guidde tol us about how Klaus dropped out to persue his cybersecurity  startup, which sold  to IBM for over $2,000,000,000.[^inflation]

In my  early-action appliation top Tech, I explicitly mentioned the program in terms of my first blockchain startup, mMMonerAds.[^man-relevance] Uponadmission , i applied  to the submmer  profram freshman year. However, I was told after pitching a penale on my ideas that I could not joing wihtout a cofounder.

This began years of wresting with otheer peoples' vision  for how I should run a transgfer agency,[^notad]  since  "most  startups fail without a cofounder."[^apprx]  Whiel I apprecciate thos entiments, I found the discipline to  patiently wait for the right opportunity in  the unforgiving Indifferencce of market quiet. This approach paidd off four  yeras later when I encountered the excpetional partner cited in PREV  § III.

ONe year after m ,eeting Jerry in _supra_ note {{notad}}, he began teaching graduate cyberseucrty  classes. They introduced me  to the  immense centralized  risks  of concerntring market PII and MNPI ,[^intro-frens] exmeplified  in Ex . 8.8,  a report  on the Equifax data breach. Throughout the semester, we'd walk after lecturees disucssing market  structure and contemplateions on ssecuring a self-custody blockchain TAD.


[^createx]: THe program itemslf acted as a typical startup  incubator  with experienced  indsutry mentors. To  the  extent it relates  to t his Exma,  it  included the oipportunity to contnually  pitch investors. While  I alwyas new  the  shares would need to reside in a nonprofit, I played along with these charades. This experiinec gave me respect  for small-business cpaital formatioon, as Donna commented on July 15th.


[^inflation]: Inn 2025  dollars.


[^man-relevance]: I cited these years ofexperience in our first meeting as background for the remote-dirst organizatioonal design which I understand to  best efficiently  orgnazie a free-software working community.  I find relevant  the publis Secretarof-of-State filings ;'s privacy reldactions and inclusions, _available at_ https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/Business_Registration_profile/14324280. North  Caolrina follows's the  commission's policy of censoring emails while publishing full physical addresses and  phgone numbers. However, I disagree with their requirmenet of a "principal opffice" which was my parent's house asnd, in the Articles  avaliable under "View  Filings"  with No. C201815700063, the fmaily  residence of a friend.

[^notad]: Nobody understood what a TAD was, and  it was too  mcuh  effort with the scarse public documentation back  then  to  satisfactory  convince them of  the need  for such  a new  system. Namely, I was  bafflingly unfamiliar with the TAR letter'ss PCO event, despite an explicit suprise reference thereto in a school pitch competition touted by the tour  guide which immedeiatyley  intreuiged me, _available at_ https://youtu.be/S75IvkicWD8. THe m onths of pitching prepration for this show introduced me to valuable earl yonnections, many o f whom are in the exmaple shareholder ledger prop, _available at_ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgBoJeKZ_EPy8Dlwd4dARyRCniqcET0VR1IDkrx4kKY/pub. one  paritcualtlryu relevant judge fdrom  early  pitch-practice and  application sessions was Jerry {Perullo, the ICE CISO for two decaddes quotesd  in  the EDGAR comment at 21.

[^apprx]: Approximate paraphrase  of  the repeated statistics I heard regaurding  failed solo foudners.  Ex. 8.7 is a reponse to this critique drafted at the end of 2019 and submitted to the comittee early  in 2020 to finalize my rejected iingagural application. This ultimately let me move on from a venture which  was frnakly harmful to the environment and consumer technology, as I had practically came  to recognize  mby the later stages of the  applciatin process.  THerafter, I published my thesxis and, within a year pushign through COVId hardships, incorpoated the early-fform Registrant. 



[^intro-frens]: These two  fdeadly  acronyms have  been tmy  top concenrns  in open0-sourcing  Syndicate  ifnrastructure  over the last years. I  found  in early  development  efforts  details  _infra_ § {{TODO:team section number}}  that it can be challenging  to  extensively test interface deplyoments without established and volumnous sample data.  This is why  I issued  teh DEMO asset from the Syndicate's mainnet account, facilitating early code sprints.  I plan to overccome this  challenge  with  future  testneet integrations and faker users.


###### Exchange Software LIcenccing Decision

LArge b rokers (including those rtunning an ATS) and the uncovered clearing agencies are the backbone of markets, making up the critical NSCC participant-base.  Staff identied  this and sought to  regulate awayt risks.

IO share this uqote  from Jerry[^aadversarial] befcause I eblievve wholehearely that we can achieve the due andnecccesary increased cyber protections Americans more effiociently wirh the  poen-soyece principles shared regaiirding  an  investor identity verification software. I  have adopted these working principles in all that  I do, as shown for  exmaple  by  the crafting of this entire response on Github, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/SEC-publications.

What I'm getting at has been deeply intertwiend with my Examnication resposnes since citing community sentiments in Resposnse  3  note  11. It's a decisiokn  to decentralize  control  and economic benefit from a select  corporation or association  of intermediates,  in  gfavcor  to investor quality. We gface a  paramount decision as  to  the  Commission's  immediate  resposne  to DA's "tokenized  securtities,"  dframed within out circles[^bob-meme]  as very distinct paths for investors and the future of law.





[^aadversarial]: _See_ rountbale disussion withh vwterab ccybersecurity executivies acting in c-suite roles largely  involved  in financial  services  or  data lakes, _available at_ https://adversarial.com/blog/the-adversarial-podcast-ep-8-pagers-and-supply-chain-attacks-github-stealers-founder-mode.  At 48:21, Jerry  summarizes  a shared, agreed perspective  that open  tools have historically  proved  more reseliant,  secure, and trusted than the proprioetary infrastructe  of central actors presently  encompassed  by enhanced Commission tehcnological oversight.   I;ve shared the podcast with technically-inclined community memebrs as great  permissionless education . We can do it.

[^bob-meme]: _See_ bottom image comparing finanical infrastructure  to  railroad  tracks, with DTCC on a very different path than certain public blokchain syustems which inmpklcitly  facilitate peer-to-peer trade through a layer-one decentralized protocol.  THe  posts responds to reamrks regarding the funciton of markets to serve socierty  by driving innovation and  prosperioty, a key  objective of all  my  work  given the tendancy fo public  companies running exchanges to prioritize theri bhistghest-frequency customers, who have the least to do with the efficient formation of capital supporting the rise of business and employment for masses of Americans.  WE can't let Wall Street dictate  our lives because their forefathers  laid yesteryear's iron tracks. What if we all had equal access to the market for capital at a local level?





###### Proprietary Verses Individual Custody

Durngt he summer we registed withthe Commission, Klaus and their team told us about their experiences and cpitall. After denying a n offer to invest in the FFirm, klaus explained an enterprise internet-sale  to NASA. The company convinced the agency to purchase their cyberpseccurityy spftware/, and Klaus was just about to walk into the closing room to snegotiating a gee to outfit protection on all their computers.

Given the novelty  of port protection in the early 2000s., A mentor told him to ask for ten times whatever he would charge. i see our markets in a simialr sstate today, where the backend systems can extract as much rent as spreads statutoritly  allow. with no alternative  ott he leveraged central clearing rail, investors must give  up direct ownership no matterr the  cosst just to trade atall

We onyl  had so muh past technology to deal with The flaws of central  closed instuttiional registration.[^paperowrk-crisis] As society  forced costs down  through  infrastrucutre innovation, we unntentionaly centralized legal registers into a single electronc record, akin to a select compoerx service vendor.[^mom-fidl] But today Wall Street sells a product trivially replced by  distriubtedlrdgers for free.

NASA paid th e xorbitatnt rate because there weren't modern decentralized open0sourced  solutions  putting everyone on the same playing field, just as most investors  hadnd untold billions into plumbing enabled by indirect beneficial ownership. In reflectig on CISO reference materials and observation of managed cyber platforms'  growht,[^awscollege] I've concluded the most efficent  systems allows the flexability of decen talized  open  implementaions  with imrpovements  returned to the shared project l.[^agpl-setns] I want to bring this decentralized  self-custod y  ethos  from  indepndent code ownership into the market with a DEX.




[^paperowrk-crisis]: _See_ study  commintcated from the  Commission  to Congress  two  years before DTC's formation, examinging ddecades-long  sturcutral changes  to teh capital markets, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1970/1971_0310_SECInstitutionalInvestor_01.pdf. Extensive staff research  form Chapter I to II find insitutional ownership soared as concentrated custodians "ncreased their share of total stock outstanding from less than 7 percent to approximately 19 percent" in  the lead-ip to the Paperwork Crisis. This coincides with Commission  requests for the dominant exchasnge relinquishing mandated trading fees at 9, bringing  free-market cost  to  block trades for the first  time  since the brokers' 1972 oligopoly agreement. Do we have enough mass-market participants again?


[^mom-fidl]: For isntnace,  my Mom held dirctly-regfistered hares of Merk for ddecades, participating in their dividend reinvestment Plan. Reviewing TA statemments  for her position revealed histoirc  fees in lei of compounding investments which inspired early contrmplations on investor pricing, _available at_ https://github.com/JFWooten4/DRIP-fee-impact. Hisotriccally, even these costly  charges uncdercut top brokkerage rates; but, as staff know,, competative changes mmoved the industry  to profits from custody, routing, and lending. This grab for all possibvle ccollateral led my Mom's broker to call her requesting she deposit  her share swith them for "safekeeping and consolidation" in  a single account without legal control in insolvency, as freely  admitted by CCP proponents when testifieying on   perfected interests.


[^awscollege]: _See, e.g.,_ disucssion over proporietary  security  services diuscoivered  through AWS startup program offering a central hosting solution akin  to contituent  software polatforms,, _available at_ https://zopen.to/K8CAHO5DfzKCt1eNINvS. Thisa devleopkemtn approach moimics initial staff impresions of TAD3 from the  first meeting, which  I understand as consistentg of a system deployed complemtelt yu over a service provider with control of data/. As we see with questionable  FTD data  rom the TAR  letter  nn. 11, 24, and 32–35; such ce tralizty  rarely wokrs in the long-run. Even Jerry replies with enohgh caution to "definitely steer clear so there is no chance they think I grabbed their idea" given the natural uneccesary copetition between similar fundmanetal established ingrastructure.


[^agpl-setns]: This is precisely  what I've  been  getting at with  the relentless  citation a nd use  of the Affero GPL, an established standard  for  interoprerable dervitive  software system improvmenets. It  takes what might  start  as  a  centralized p roejct  and allows the communtiy  to  expand  funcitonality  bgasedo mn their own pproved needs as  they use a  system. After deep exokoiration of distirbuted projects for months leading up to  PREV n.20 link 1,a timeline communicated in our first meeting, I came ot the conclusion  that this licensing  approach  may  well be the o ly means  to maintain shared infrastructure  for decades with  the public trasnprency enccerasry for market functiojnality. At least without the token incentives  of cryptonetworks iwth  consensus mechisms  which have all total value sa systemic insurance.



###### Alternate Trading Venue Problemsd


Lastly, the dropped rulemaking dismissed the 2022 amendments to the definition of an exchange, as was so famously subject to comment by the crypto industry.[^Peirce] I care  most intimately about the qualiryt of excchange infrasture in the public  markets, bassed on the immense transaction costs Wall Street's taken from me and my mfamily over and over again.[^enda-sewlf] While such a large market-structure change should not be tucked away in a proposal for Treasuries, the fact remains that proponents of central exchanges can view some blockchain systems as silos of liquidity devoid of protection  given inagural implementations which skirted the line between centrally-cntrolled d unregulated exchanges.[^venue-prot] 

In years of exploration into ATS regulations, history, and operations, much of my interpretation came from a brief email exchange with Anthony Weeresinghe about one year before the Commission brought action against Ustocktrade. In just a brief rejection of bona fide help to our college Design team, thousands of pages of legislative history crystallized into my view understanding these broker-dealers as relentlessly self-interested firms with profits solely derived through intermediating trade.[^fine-fn] Comparatively, my constituents use blockchain market-makers for exemplary fraud investigations using nothing more than block explorers thanks to the public transparency afforded by distributed ledgers using legitimate consensus, a form of indepdenndet decentralized stability not afforded to shahreolders transsacting on central servers.


I prefer public blockchains which, in their own continuing operations, prove themselves as secure with no need for central attestation based on proprietary principles, as adopted in an ecosystem mantra that Bitcoin is the world's largest bug bounty since any vulnerabilities can make you a fortune. As laid out in the TAR letter n.149, I've seen  this ethods direcltry imrpove our own udnerslying infrastrucure, and I I kknow that we  cna  get the rollout o DDEXes right  over time. That's why I''m so concerned over the hastley rollout of DA without due consideration of  its real market-structure and stability risls.

ASs  laid out in the TAR letter § II.B, DA prposes for the irst time to lower trading  costs byh interleaving margin between participants' CCP accounts. Regarless of trading  venue employed, my  interpertation of the SRO rule changes to date reads  that the industry will afford huge implmentation leeway  to the already-mighty DTCC. Any mishandling has been scoped  as catostophic by Commissioner Peirce in TAR  letter n.21, todo

given ii.b.1



[^enda-sewlf]: I na  last-ditch effort ot buy part of Block Transfr at the end of the program "demo day," Klaus directly ogfered "any help I may need" under the clear and later-verified implication of direcyt economic benefit, a tradeoff I find unnaceptable vassed  on perosnal sentiments well explained in TAR letter n.175  en t oto. He miught have gotten exactly what he asked NASA fr given  a lack of alternatives, just as  brokers hold  unchallenged keys to  access the legacy exchange infrastrure build on centrlized, closed custody chains. But I do not believe  arjkets need profit-seeking intermediaries that squeeze every possible micro-cent  out of cxollective sacings and retirments. I ssee outr best opporuntiy  for sustainable efficient markets in nonprofit infrastrue designed with investor priotections and capital formation abovve and beyond limited c04[porate shareholder-value  interests, becuase certain natural monpoiplies just  don't intergrate well with default capitalist cgovenrnace  with so mucch at stake.

~~## B. MSF Certificate Detail~~

In writing the prior subsubsection, I noticed a single-brick lego was  ajar on a Mellenium falcon model  in my office. I had a simialr exprience noticng  a single missing brick out of a dozen completed sets while in therapy  for cvonditions disussedd  in the email submitting Respon #2 sent on 16 Jun 2025 at 4:40pm ET.  Mymind just notices all the little things in  systems, wanting everything in its place.

This drive led me to begin all this work because I just don't stand the cclear flaws in legacy clearing / Over  time, this expanded  to  almost all legaccy financciaa lsystems ands I felt the painful innefficiny  again andd again,  before mucch of my bsuiness access was simlpy revoked. IN preparing for the event in {{{{{{Todo: supora.infr idkfk for the discussion/46  Vegas href}}}}}},  I remarked  to  my Dad  frustrations over  ABS offerings bedcaause of thsi same inability to proccess without fixing mistkaes.[^pre-,arks]

I jut  disagree with large swaths of their business pracctices, and so I decided to find technolgoies that let the market  obviate their roles. Genslar jokes  about how you'd need to reingeer the whole market system to truly implement blockchain  , in hsi first MIT OpenCoursware cclasss. I've refrncedthat so many times in DUNA disucssions becuase I heard  those words and just spent years looking into the "why not" side

Even in drawfting  my written prepratory remareks, I knew I count's make it to  the moot ppoihnt in note 1 regarding decentralized communal efforts because of the clear expensive frim-sp[onsored tickets attendees all had around their necks, _available at_ https://github.com/users/JFWooten4/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=81176338. The thing that really ets me on beuorcratic politcking calls with panelists preparing over the years was how I could pbring a point up like the signifcance of community friendship, have everyone niod their heads in agreement on needed collaboration items, an then never mention it gain.

















### Physical  Securities and Lifeccycle

 I  hope  that by  this point I hav  well esltabsohsed my intention ot operate as a digital-first  trasnfer agent. I uderstand this i s not the approach  taken  by all  agents, but I think it i s  the movst efficient for TAs using TAD3.  It  seemed i n our meetings  that  staff  were  well  unformed ofg this  spapprafdch, but they  were  still k ind  enough  to reccomend additional processes for handlings.

We do not  does not currently have written procedures pertaining to the cancellation and/or destruction of securities certificates.  Part  of the  challenge I always saw with allowing certifiecats  stems  from the location of registgration on Stgellar. There is a naive approach  of placing all certifcated hsared i n an omnibus account  similar  ot a Dsitributor account, or having us  as agent open and handle individual accounts for eacch  certificate holdder, using  central keys to sign and effect Medallion'd  trasnsferrs.

In gfolldowin g this line o f thinking, I spent months contenmpokalting the distriubtion of "certificates" in  the  form of edmbossed metal seed-phrase  cards. However, I found this faced  the same centralization  challenges  of a p;hsuycial processing  facility.[^cancel-fac] While it might be faster and easier to centrally provision everyone's account  phrasses, I know infrvesotrs receive far better security  garuntees by c ontrolling their own self-custody wlalets.[^no-nums]

Thus my inital approacch was to scan and shred oldd certificates using  the PHsycialAddress service and destruction facilities maintained at 99 Wall Street.[^whop-no]  I will  chancge these oeprating practices to maintain proper sagefaruding of certificates received in the mail in a new process whcih defines proccedures for cancllation and  destruction.[^on-only]  I'm migrating out tally journal into te CRON work detailed later nad in its own repository, and I'll add a peice for the rare shredding records of Rule Ad-19(c)(3).




[^cancel-fac]: Namel,y the distrtibtiuon of physiccal certiifcates would act  as a  central point of failure rquiring immense securityy andd oeprational  control measures only possible t hrough  centralization. In communtiy policymakign wokr, i've used the example of a DTC  processing vault my Dad helped finance in the early 2000s, employing retinal scanners. I  employed this line  of eraosning when Reading Rule 17Ad-19(a)(2),  which I'd be remiss  to not point out was written two decades ago in S7-18-00. The immense regulation and maleability  of paper documents just aslways seemed cojmpletely incompartible with my  vision  for a decentralized financial system unhindered  by nonroutine processing exceptions that  fuel FTDs.

[^no-nums]: _See_ onbaording flow for local seed gneration and physiccal user storage, used to sign trasnactions in a warm wallet in the sense that compatible apps submit authenitcated messsages  to Horiizion nodes. This approac leeps securities in a fundgivble pool within the investor's account on Stellar,. onbaoting unique or serial certificate numbers given balances automatically denominate up to secen decimal places in response  to transfer items. Even the "destruction"  or  "canccellatioon" exmeplified in the DMEO burning transaction stayt completley evidenced on the deistributed ledger with out "physical ruination" or disposal needs. While there's  an argument Rule 17Ad-19(a)(7) covers such an everbt,  it  was m y  reading that this only  applied  to acctual paper  certificates. Given the use og "printed" in 17 CFR § 240.17f-1 ("Rule 17f-1") paragraph (a)(6).

[^whop-no]: I sincerly appreciate staff clarifyting that this  would not be  an acceptable operating stragety given the use of employes not fingeripritned by the FBU udner Rule 17f-2. I do understand  the legacy stamping perforation process typically followed before shredding, but I failed to see how that makes a differnece iven a decent cross-cut macchine. It  seems I failed  to  contemplate  under Rule Ad17Ad-12 the  conseuqences off having an outside party blidnly  open certificatees which could contain investor i nformation. I have not previously considered items usch as address or legacy certificate number as top safegaurding concers  outside of the registed PII datbaase because the only way to trnasfer securitiers in my  mind comes from cryptographic poor laid out in our signature-gaurntee policy. 

[^on-only]: These changes will  be  clearly made publicly  in an issue audit  log, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/TAD3/issues/3. They will involve the  creation  of  written operating proccedures minimizing interactiosn with ccertifiactes, since the  closest thing i have  to  controlled access is a lock on the front  door. Addditionally, I will contactl Laylor and let them know not ot h ave any certificates sent to us for shredding, nullinfying  the  old destruction lclause in our Agrreemnent. GOing forward, we will use  a standard open-0source issuer  template which defined mandatory keyh  privosions,  so  that this disnonenct between business model and TAD3 compatabitliy will not again face issuer-specific discrepency, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/TAD3/issues/4.



#### Certificate Cancellation and Destruction

IN the  early days of Blokc Transfer, I joined Kenmark's STAMP  program becuase  I thought innefifcinet procees were backed into the law. There I saw firsthand just how troublesome physical trasnfer agraunteesx cna be even with a comprehensive oversight newtokr.[^stamp-los] I am glad we can  move past this histeopric limitation with uncertiifcated securities erpresented in token specie on an issuer ledger.


UNFBorpiituily, other regulations do write especific  corporate interests into our "nationa' market  functions. [^crohnyies] I take  particular issue with the Lost and Stolen Securities Program with tis associated Form X-17F-1A filings, based on an otudated viewed of  unccertificated trading.[^basios=:LSSP]

15 U.S.C § 78q ("Rule 78q") clause (f)(1)(A) reuqires  transfer agents to "report to the Commission  [opr its designee]... information about securities that are missing, lost, counterfeit, stolen, or cancelled[.]" Sincei mplmeneting the  cCOngressional reuqiremnt, a designee which ultimately  came under the operation  of DTC  managed  this progframe for the intenture industry,  as stafgf know.  Howeever, at the start  of this year, this responsabiltiy  was  outsourced to a tehcnology  consultant for no consideration.[^accenture]

I sincerly  appreciate that the prPorgram  is no lunder run by the DTCC, and I offer nothing but the highest a ccolades  for diligent staff effort to streamline industry  services, especially  when  such  changes decentrqlaize power amongst dispaerrsed participants with competing interests. I also applaoud the orignal purpose of Rule 78q in clause (f)(3)(A)  to investigate  criome.  Hpowever,  IO doubt that missing stock  certyifiacates are as high up on th4e Attonereyt  Gener;ls agenda today, required exnrtive ongoing use  of the National Crime Information Center.


[^stamp-los]: _See, e.g.,_ saales brocure  for the physical  rubber stamps used at  legacy  agents, _available at_ https://kemark.com/assets/stamp2000equipment.pdf. The footer' sbarcode reference sectikon refernces  the  "missing equiptment database," promoitign  the easyt of checking  euqpiotment  wiht a guatnor  and location ID number. In investigating  agent  onboarding mateirals, I learned just how often these industry-standard  stamps are lost  of stolen from  gaunrtorr institutions. THus, by maing agents constnatly  check agianst a list of know fraudulent stmap numbers, the progrma losses credible effficacy  with a centralized  certificate uathoritry, which again goers against every principle I know of good c ryptosystems.

[^crohnyies]: _See, e.g.,_ CTA/CQ Plan LLC and  UTP Plan LLC wihtihn SIP specificaitopns  of regualtions I will no cite for  relevance focus  on the  NMS Statue., As staff  presently  werest with skyrocketing  central costs of a crucial swap reporting facility, I'd like to remind myself i n this submission archive of the materiallyh  these  choices  have for investor  confridence, as shown in a ocmmuntiy p ost, _available at_ https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1k1pmgr/comment/mnpj6je. We've discussed this extensively on our podcast,  including specifc remarks regarding the last-0minute delays andd petition  commenting wiht post author WhatCan incorporated in wokring items surrounding this Exmaination.  I don't  feel it's fair to talk about the lsost  securities cancellation progrmas  wihtout implciatingf thisese larger marekt record difference problems peprptuated.

[^basios=:LSSP]: _See_ staff report resoibnduibg ub poart to rule upodates refernece _supra_ note {{^cancel-fac}} desccribing  the Program in iequivalent terms  to its present mateiral operations, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/377fin.pdf. At 3,  staff  refernbce the Program's basis  in  aoutj lastg  CCongressional review  of market plum,bing which  resulted  in signfiianct settlment reform,  from five decades ago  and  cited  in TAR letter nn.57, 140,.  I bring u jp age because  we are wrestling with a bruopractically-defined government interjection  of markets just not relevant to the  current indsutry tstructure of pioneering foreruinners. I view it as  an ongoing hindereance to  capital formation which serves  only  as a form  of red tape  blocking new entrants, as  hown by Reccomandation  C's unfathomabtly-meaningfless "suggest[ion] that SIC hold LSSP Advisory Board meetings on a semiannual or annual basis."

[^accenture]: _See_  firs tnew designation of stolen  securities program to AccentureFederal Services LLC, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2025/34-102541.pdf. This change came a yer  and  a half after  the  Commission  posted a statement  of work with  over 100 pages o f  minute details and a massive deliverables schedule inclujding migratikon  from DTC's systgems, _available at_ https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/043b0ba1bdd044adaef40c470c8217a0/download.  At §  H-3, staff  clatify  that  Accenture will collect  fees from Program participants,  presenting a government-0mandated expense ot a private  company  for up to the next  decade if elected  underf §   F-2. THe govenrment goes on to mandate fee categories and relative sizes in § C.1,  whcih  I might  contruew as interjection in the fre market using rules defined by beurcrats in 1978  alongside the  Depostory Trust  Compnay.


#### Lost  Ceritifcet Statoru Programming

We  doinl;t kliuve in the decades of past  where bearer  cveritifcates and lost  coupons create major problems/.[^ffiar-ok] SDtaff note that  "Rule 17Ad-19(b) under the Exchange Act requires every transfer agent involved in the handling, processing, or storage of securities certificates to establish and implement written procedures for the cancellation, storage, transportation, destruction, or other disposition of securities certificate."  However,m  in  crteating and adopting such a policy above nad beyond naive shredding, I am conbcerned that succh processing  rulsetops may be consuted as "business activities"  which "involve the handling of securities certificates"  under  Rule 17f-1(b).

In our sedcond meeting, I placed emphasis on how legafcy inmported investgor  balances were "static" except in the  case of issuer discresion liek splits.[^outtaway] In this light, I epxlained how legaccy postions uporiurted  by the issuer  or  communcciated fro m an ougoing agent  are taken at face value as registered on any MSF  or stocholder list, not as endoreses on certificates not communiccated before migration. This treatmnt aligns with the registration requiremnt of securities and indsutry standards to require Medallion endorsement of physcial transfers alongsidde submission of any materials  for processing.

Because all certificates are ignored  by rule,[^nullvoid]  I do not think it would be fair  to cclassify  us  as  a reporting instution under Rule 17f-1(a)(1). IN analysing the  content  of  Form X-17F-1A, I furhter posit such reeports wouldd noit make sense for outr business because of the inability  to lsoe digital assets i n a manner such as those defined in line 4.[^seed-phrase]  TYHe investors h ave something  much closer to  "digital  gold"  (for l ack  of  a btetter metaphor) whiuch crucially is  abundantly  apparent  when invovvled in  fraud, thanks  to the  on-chain montiorign of _supra_ § {{Alternate Trading Venue Problemsd TODO}} 

I ebelive  a  Transfer  Imporvmeent  Proposal ("TIP")  standard desinged  alongside  communtiy contributors will best protect i nvestors by  laying  out  a  shared rframework for identifying, investigating, and rectifying on-cyhyain crime using agent-controlled  trustline  managmeent. Givven attmeped dismatnlings of  th4e CFPB in _National Treasury Employees Union v. Russell Vought, 25-5091, (D.C. Cir.)_, I further ind it  quesitonable if law enforcement's centralized database within Acccentuire policing will help protect h te public more than existing  SRO  enforcement  actions upheld by  _Alpine's_ immierdiate rejection. THese rules  make proecesjusral isolations for  certificates, but the point o f  my  work in TAR letter § IV was a distinct protection  for  all  invoestors using secure DRS records.




[^ffiar-ok]: I think  that's  a fair statemnet.  Whether it  was  DTC  or others (this  is the only  point I will given  them a lifelien on), dematerialization  changed  market  strucutre in ways not adequately  responded to by regulation after the  pflaws revelaedx  in Rergulation SHO.  In a new market structure, even one generously  presumed around DA,  there no longer needs  ot  be a phyusical policing  force out  searchinkg or  destorying  mssing certifiactes.  THe larger  lookmign  cyber problems  of stolen account  crednetials back almsot all the fraud I've investigated, and  the only  rememdly legacy agents  have for this is sending  paper mail verificaiton  codes.

[^outtaway]: ADmittedly, I did  make manual adjustments to the legacy datbalse's holdings on the basis of the Stock Revocation. However, this i s not an expected access pattern I believe our  services or lredger ought support. Issuers do not generally  have the autghoirty to rescint  issued ssecurtiies, and I want t o strengthen  the language in our arrangments form _supra_ note {{^on-only}} link 2 to  prevent such  an instance in the futurre. NBaemklym, I will use the onboarding lessons pending  documentation alonlgside other posiliciesy pages related to REsposne 7  aas basis for requioerikng new clients to haver comprehensive sharheodler infromation, in thte sensxe that they are certain of suhc persons' intent to hold shares, as sopposed to  an "airdrop" with ongoing outrach; _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/website/tree/ee725d7cc9ae09a4bc04a61275fd010266328533/compliance/team.

[^nullvoid]: THe LAylor  Agremeent i nlcuded  a clause delcaering past  certifiaces null and vboid, which is why  I included  the address for shredding facilities. THe corp;roate decree to remove the  status of these securities  certifiecates justiofied  the handling  of destruction by extenal  parties,  in my  mind.  HOwever,  I think this declaration (if it's even val id  in various courts o f law) is asking too  much  from the isseur, copariesd to the much  easier route of just saying they cannot be used anymore and should be kept or  disposed  of at shareholders'  weill.  Any  communcciated  ceritifcaten umbers form an ouitgoin agent  would ahve  no palce within TAD3's data  standards aznd hense no bearing o n operations.

[^seed-phrase]: The exceptoipn here, of  course,  is a crpyotrgrpaohic seed phrase. This is why I put  so much wokr into both the identity  recovery  verificaiton system design and DUNA  governemna ce for the adffifrmation of rule logic surroudnign verified  account restoration funcitonaljitry, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/py-TAD3-horizon/blob/def8aaa17338073afe871de5881a30e406ba3d3c/investors/executeVerifiedRestore.py.  I find this incredibly iumportant for enabling  efficeint  trusted access to  Stellar since this will be msost ivnestorss' first time interacting with  a web3 applicatikon, hadnling thier own ownership keys in self-custody.  _See also_ an exmaple of fdecentrtalized ocmmunity discussion  directloy rfelated to Commission objectives in relation  to precisely this saferty feature, _available at_ https://github.com/JFWooten4/agenda/issues/7#issuecomment-2992215559. I;ve come to the  conlcusion that it'ss onyl  through sponrtanous onlien conversatiosn with passionate investors that  wr might build the best p ublic policy fully encumbering the interests  of the decentralized i nvesting  public ad hocc.


#### Exchange Act Counterfeiting REeports

Rule 78q(f)(1)(A) clearly  refers  to all securtiies.., which include any Uncertificated stock in 15 USC § 78c(a)(10). By extension under UCC § 8-501, this applies to entitlements traded at  cleairng agencies covered uyndder paragraph (1)'s paarticipation requirements.  However, it  is  my  understand o f  public  information  that  DTC  does  not  report  the cancellation of nominee-based exchange entitlements.[^tar-fuck]

As  cited  _supra_ note {{awscollege}} , 37,347,572 shares of Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc.  had  no basis in lawful issuance  on  the  coproate regfiter,  but they  appeared in Cede  & Co.'s account resulting  in  voided claims when  reconciledxc. Moreover, customer accounts and circulated in DTC’s system held  12,370,657 shares of  Dole Food Company, Inc.  in exce3ss  of auhtoirzed  shares  outstanding, which  were treated  aas  counterfeit reequivalents  in a  classa ction. _See also_ TAR  letter n.19 where  the  trasuries from Lehman customers were effectively stolen as  their  property was diverted to satisfy secured creditors, even though the beneficial owners thought they still controlled those securities; again,  not reported.

[^tar-fuck]: _See, e.g.,_ case  involving  the cancellation  of outstanding  hsares  held  by  the  CEO  of QS Energy, Inc.  in a "fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market"  through  a combination  of  public prompotions and  private  salkes of restricted  stock, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/complr17283.htm.

This information is required as part of the minimum certificate detail pursuant to Rule 17Ad-9(a) under the Exchange Act. 


However, for those securityholders without Stellar Accounts whose shares are held in the "Distribution Account", there is no clear audit trail that records the number of shares cancelled by securityholder or the date of cancellation. 
have to review several sources


As a result, BlockTrans does not maintain or have readily accessible the cancellation dates or share amounts for cancelled securities of securityholders allocating to the Distribution Account.




CRON and pen


For those securityholders who don’t maintain Stellar ccounts, the Registrant will manually delete certificate detail for cancelled securities. At present, deleted certificate detail for these securityholders would be reflected in backup files maintained by BlockTrans. However, the Registrant does not have a process to back-up and maintain the certificate detail for these securityholders which resides in the Legacy Database.




BlockTrans’ failure to establish a process to ensure that back-up files of the Legacy Database are maintained is an internal control weakness, 

as such process could ensure that BlockTrans maintains a record of certificate detail deleted from the MSF as required by Rule 17Ad-10(f) under the Exchange Act.

## § 3 Ddistributed Aautonomous P)hyscial Address

I apprecaite  stgaff refrfering otm e by the "Principal/Founder"  titles used in past filings, rather  than  the arbitary  "Chief COplaince oFficer" title  of past  Repsones. As  is hopefulyl  clear by now, I prefer desinging systems which  themselves,  or  in conjucntion with a decentralized govenrance group, protect i nvestors withgoujt the stradiional hierarchal  authority o f  a beiurpcratioc decision-making body. TAR  letter  n.81 exemplifies the abject failures thyis approach  can have on   iniviudal investoirs, and my decentralized  approach serves  to further goalsd  to bring the market up without a central long-term  point of failure.

IkN orpgnaizing our phsyical or mailing address, I 'd liek to remkar that beihng the "onyl employee" now, while my own interpretaion, may not ven be a fair one given all of us in the  communrity hjasve been "paid" $0 from the Sndicate as actors.[^noincome] iN duisccussing this unique strucutrfe wuhtg  many   outside  the  Commission,   I wqant  to clarifyy  that  ithis  is  notr  a small phase before we onboard larger issuer  clients.  If  anything,  I  want  less  and  less dirfect  invovlement between represntatigeive poeple  nad  any potential MNPI gained  from dierct d iscussion s  with insiders.[^saslesarrangmentgs]

I  will  reiterate one more time  my plane    for  share donation of mey  entire class-E position  s in TAR Letter at 66, syaing i wiill " donate my shares in the company to WhyDRS," marking ep rhass  the first nonproofit trasnfer agent in  direct contraditction  to cojmmentors on industry regualtions conflated i wht ohnly  for-profit eagnts subject ot conflcicts of interest.[^meetingapprov]  By making  this shift, IO hope to incent  more expoenential individual contributiosn, as much web developemtn can be expontenitally faster with a select few experts. I saw  this  in my  dyears of  building  out  the  backend  TAD3 functionsd, as everything  can be built and dociumentsed  based o n a deep uderstandign o f fosource mateirals.[^gfootball-xc]

I've  worked  extensively iwth this authior in recent work including a peittion submitted  during our E maniaiton and contextuial  sources  in the  TAR letter, adn I'm continually  amazined by  their  decication and efforts despite no direct  market compensiton  for their immense passion  to do good.

### TA-1 Principe Office Address

Part o f this hwole conccept si that there is not addressable "principal office where transfer agent activities are, or will be, performed." WhatCan  as one  of so many collaborators greatly values  thier anonmytity and georgrpahic isolation, creating tangential  progress like  thae update to DSPP  share owernshp locate disclosures at a major TA last year.[^update-cs]  THis is  expwscially  tgure as  issuer and SYdnicate deplyoments rely on mutlisignature wallets with disperrsepd signers, as orally communcicated  in our last meeting when I was insturcted to bring these points up with the Divisio nof Trading  and Mrketsd.

Notwithstiang this and adiditonal commehnts, discussions with the Registrant revealed that the 99 Wall Street address is the location of a virtual business address service that receives/handles mail for clients, and BlockTrans does not maintain any personnel here. This is ture, and I have  changed the line-3 physcial   locatiojn of the Firm as requested.[^ta-upodt] Reflectively, , ther ei s nothign special about  my p erson  as  an oeprator of  most eldgered balances maintianed in TAD3, given  particualy  that hte  SYdnicate does not maintgain  any vclaidotr infrasture  based on  the work  neededc  to affirm  independcdnt  exchange protocol  order  submissions communciated i n oiur  last meeting.

But  a slight left turn  brings  collected  locomatives under the mainline and i nto a collection  of  local rail oops   dating  bacck to the late 1800s.

*I suspect that staff  in  other divisions may  agreed  wiht my  interpetaaiton of indiviudal rolkes  in  remote-first orgnaizaitons such as  those detialed i n our jintial exmaminerf explanation chain, emailing inforaiton about public comment submitted in relation to online -only    filers.  Far be it fo me to guess at internal agency processings, but it ttook  the Commission over three times  asd long to process this TA/1  as did  the 2023  update referenced in the  Defficicicny letter.f PErhaps they took pause  in a resuidieanl address sourced as  an officec  space, which  I have not seen very often  exmaining opther small trasnfer-agent  filer.s

I appreciate that teh Commission's used to aplying its laws to centralized organizaaions with principal ffices and hierarchal organiztion reporting.

###  Team Mail Processing  POlicy

I've lawyas known wwe'd expand  and someone else would ahandle PHysiclaAddressss  mailroom digital  rpocessing,m resulting in  necesary public poilikccy. I'vve  avoided developing these standrds because historic implmentaitons woudl be  impliclty  centralized  as directive working instructions in a hirerachal centrali organzaiton,.[^laibilty] However,  I hbave  a better scope  of vision for  authority-light team expansikon  to routine items like  KYC processing,  which I intent to matujre going  forward including through this processing.

I wonder now  to  staff what our  examinatiohn juresdictikon wilkl look l ike given the Commission'd  regional-office  operating model. And  rI question if it would affect the  consistency  of  exmamination udnerstanding to limit material -  shareing  to  a  singel jursidction or not.  I liekd the orignial New-Yokr registration because  I repr4e44sumed it  would  be  the most  sccruitinaous examijnation region of possible addreses.?[^addr-loc]

Whilie I do not agree  with teh changes  in public lcoale inforation, I appreciate staff effforts  to streamline regualtory oversight.[^packages]  ONe  option I've alwyas had  configured is  an aexternal review account wihtr limited read permissions across all mail  items.  I have configured for years now this custom account profile which can  connect to any communcated staff  email for permissionless access  to all  p[rocessed materials  and  autdit lgs of access hisotry.[^audiot-optikons]

I understand the role physical visits  used to play, and so  I would be happy to cover spacce for staff to move into the other  side o f our duplex since our neigtbors moved out last week,

[^audiot-optikons]: For secretasrial a ssistence  , the permissioning options define granular user access controls, ranging from administrative actions (such as updating company settings, users, and senders) to envelope-level operations (viewing, archiving, moving, deleting, forwarding, or scanning contents), as well as account functions like billing, blocking senders, and managing folders.  TRhis  will allow accouints which can only add and process  mail items wihtout  any option  to remove  potential mail  items into the trash  before sccanning them. While out po;licy has  been to  scan all meail as soon as it  comes it, the updating processing poilicy will  flesh  this i nto a more reactive policy sensativve to  investor  information and orgnaizaitonal pricacy.


### Early Tea,m Working Arrangements

Beofer the  distributed  open-source developkment now leading outr work, I communicated in our  first meeting  earl yexperiences with collegeiate working peers.[^app-demo] Ex  8.5 contains  earlyh  consideration  and  rights arrangmenets  withg  implicatged  team  mermebrs designed  around central emplyoment and transfers of IP  for Affero if elected bny  the Syndicate.  I  will continue working on  bringing  developers o nto this project  wiht  continued efforts  to  ahcieve communtiy funding,  as commmunicated in the email preparing  for our second meeting's schedulign.[^ptick]

I'm happy  with  hwat we  were able  to accomil;push  in  our short time together, showing the potential  groweth o f  these w porks joined  otgether in  a strictly  central  orgnaization with  direct selling. This was  particuly well  exmepolified in   our prepartory remarks and sugbmission  to  the disuccssed Senior Design  Expo, _available at_ https://expo.gatech.edu/prod1/portal/portal.jsp?c=17462&p=413142918&g=413665329&id=416518489.

I remember talling my p artenr[^1artenr]]  last novemebr  that I was  going  ot need some space  to work extremely  hard compiling my TAR comment.[^2comment]  She eotred  that everytign  would jsut be normal beccause that;s about the  speed I always work. I found the retorkt humenrous and drew direct parellles form  _Fred Brooks’_  sentiments in  _The Mythical Man-Month_, claiming that you can’t fry an egg faster by adding more cooks .

In its most literal interpretation,  the size o f a devleopment team doesn't matter  if one or two people  don't have they  ir heads wrapped  around  the  sdcope of efforts.

At  14, the early h wqokring group  presents our strenghts,  despite fgaacing intial rejection  from decentralizing commuintiy fuinding mechanismms.   Without this support,  much  of  these  early  efforts  dissapeated,  as  evidenced  by  terminariton arrangments i n Ex.  8.5.2.1, laergely due  ot team  members  continuing on to  gradute educations while  I continue  wroiking full-time on the Registrant. _See also_   Fiogma design work  nad  early  imenetnentions under the  group  and rarrnagments  for  IssuerlInk  prototyleps  based o n  market feedback., which  I  am continuing to seek support developing collaborativey, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/issuerlink.

[^1artenr]: Ms. Melton was disucssed in our  first  meeting in relation to her patrticipatikon in the filing  of Form ID for our first  client, as more thotrhoruhgly communitcated in the EDGAR  letter at §§ I.B,  I.C.1. Th eltter goes on to express concerns over the cnetrlaization of notary services, including  online, I’ve seen ddespute help from my partenr without written contract. AS communcciated orally, we cohabitate and generally she has access  to my office space, but Kayla does not perform ongoing dueitres for the Syndicate or have a direft working arrnaglement.   I understand that this was  a relative inconsistnecy in our Agreement, and I will not haeve her involved in any m ore deals in any operating  capacity  as  agent.



[^2comment]: _See_  draft migration to open-source codebasse  after nearly a  year o f ccontemplation, _available at_ https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/commit/47a54e2240418632588831e0f54a40845e5cdd9e . This  work ultiumately matured into Response 1  note  20 gioven the severity  of  our present situation which  I’ve touched  briefly  in  PREV §§  0.B, II.B.2.a. She has been nothing but supportive of my  effforts over the years, which helpss a lot beccause onyl a  select few investrors and staff can  knoeldgab;y speak about muc h off these nuances. Admittedly  Istill have quite  a bit of  work to  do refactoring IssuerLink in  the mimmediate  future now that  Form  ID  cannot  be coplexted  by  notarized  proxy by a  service  partyh.

> The problem of ‘too central to fail’ can be addressed by reorganizing the underlying network topologies, while the problem of ‘too large to fail’ remains, at least to a certain extent. It is reasonable to conclude that for systemic risk-efficient allocations (i.e. the optimized networks) the individual systemic risk becomes more proportional to liabilities.
> 
> Policies that explicitly account for the network structure of financial markets are a necessary
and efficient way to reduce systemic risk.
