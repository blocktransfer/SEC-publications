This file has the CONT'D diction in the title file name for now because broadly there can be at least three back-and-forths between a requestor and the public liaison or affiliates regularly. This request received particularly unique treatment in that it has taken over a year to process despite being [properly formatted](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/foia-logs/foia-log-may-2024.csv) upon submission.  

## Future Work Ignored (Pollock)  

For statutory prudence of referral quality here, I want to delay the potential expansion of the WhyDRS request scope upon any objections.  

If the Pollock study itself is not available, I would also be satisfied with any internal communications referencing the Pollock study.

Ms. Outlaw,  

Yes, I'm still interested in the [original request](https://zopen.to/l3tdxhcPJHMKYcJks1aL). I appreciated prompt staff posting and processing of initial administrative efforts. Do we have an estimate of what the turnaround time could look like so that planning's easier?  

We are also curious about how staff processed or potentially received [another request](https://zopen.to/qiYR9dqDjr0DXpftBmwu) also communicated in a comment-letter footnote. Despite CC'ing the same email, an educational/non-commercial research group I work with did not receive an acknowledgment back in May. Would you be ever so kind as to affirm the liaison's interpretation of this request's perfection, as it has substantially the same language as this submission?  

Lastly, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you could point me toward the correct office for verifying whether my petition for rulemaking has been logged. I submitted a letter at the beginning of last month which has not been acknowledged or published by the Commission. Since you have experience with the uptake process, could I know a little more about petitioning?
