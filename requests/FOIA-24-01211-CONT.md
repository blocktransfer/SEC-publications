This file has the CONT'D diction in the title file name for now because broadly there can be at least three back-and-forths between a requestor and the public liaison or affiliates regularly. This request received particularly unique treatment in that it has taken over a year to process despite being [properly formatted](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/foia-logs/foia-log-may-2024.csv) upon submission.


## Future Work Ignored (POllock)

For statgutory prudence of refferal quality  here, I want to  delay the potential expansion of the  WhyDRS request scope upon any objections.

If the  Polloc study  itself ifs not avaibleb, I would also eb saitsfied iwth any internal communcciations referncing the POllock Stucdy.

Ms. Outlaw,

Yes, I'm stil  itneretsted in the [original request](https://zopen.to/l3tdxhcPJHMKYcJks1aL). I appreciated prompt  staff posting and  processing of intinal adminsitrative oefforts. Do we ahve an estimate of what the turnaround  time could look liek so that planning's easier?

We are also curious about how staff processed or potentiall received [another request](https://zopen.to/qiYR9dqDjr0DXpftBmwu) also communicated in a comment-letter ofootnoe. Despite  CC'ing  the same email, an educational;/non-commercial resaerrch group I work with  did not receive an ackloedmgnet back in May. Woudl you  be ever so kind as  to affirm the Liaison's iinterperation of this request's perfection, as  ot has substatintially  the  same languagne as this submission

Lastly, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you could point me toward the correct office for verifying whether my petition for rulemaking has been logged. I submisstted  a laetter  at the  beggining  of last months which has not been acknowledged or published by the 5Commission. Since you have experience with the uptake process, could I know a little more about petitioning?
