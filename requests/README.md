I'm not sure how often we'll use a folder like this, but I want it setup for today's drafting of the [interim statutory deadline](https://github.com/JFWooten4/agenda/issues/10#issuecomment-3110578994). It would generally function in a similar capacity to the currency [community Outreach repository](https://github.com/WhyDRS/Outreach) in my mind. But since it's specifically for Syndicate work (with a cross-ref to DRS), I just want to draft it real quick here so that I can get back to Response 8.
